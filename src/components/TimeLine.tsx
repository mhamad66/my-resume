            The parking management system, with Angular as the frontend and Dot
            Net as the backend, along with MySQL, is designed to efficiently
            handle a group of equipment, cameras, and sensors that regulate the
            operations of each parking lot. These devices transmit data to a
            central system, allowing for the monitoring of parking occupancy and
            managing payment methods. The integration of Angular and Dot Net
            provides a robust and user-friendly interface for users to interact
            with the system, while MySQL ensures secure and reliable data
            storage. This comprehensive approach to parking management is
            essential for ensuring smooth and organized operations within
            parking facilities.
